MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

6D Curve Generation:
- Each axis: X[i](t) = A[i] * waveShape[i](2π * f[i] * t + φ[i]) + offset[i]
- Where i = 0 to 5 for the 6 axes (X, Y, Z, W, V, U)

Spherical Projection (6D → 3D):
- r = √(X² + Y² + Z² + W² + V² + U²)
- θ = atan2(Y, X) (azimuth)
- φ = acos(Z / r) (polar)
- Output: (r*sin(φ)*cos(θ), r*sin(φ)*sin(θ), r*cos(φ))

Cylindrical Projection (4D-5D → 3D):
- Base: (X, Y, Z) from first 3 dimensions
- Modulation from higher dimensions applied as:
- X' = X + W * cos(t) * modulation_factor
- Y' = Y + W * sin(t) * modulation_factor  
- Z' = Z + V * modulation_factor

PRESET PATTERNS FOR MULTI-AXIS:

Chaotic 6D Pattern:

- Decreasing amplitudes: 1.0, 0.5, 0.33, 0.25, 0.20, 0.17
- Different wave shapes per axis for complex patterns
- Creates aperiodic, non-repeating curves

Flower Pattern (4D):
- Harmonic relationships: 5, 8, 13, 21 Hz (Fibonacci sequence)
- Creates flower-like patterns when projected to 3D
- Uses mixed wave shapes for organic appearance
