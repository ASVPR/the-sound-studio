   - Mathematical frequency relationships (ratios, harmonics)

2. ADVANCED MODULATION SYSTEM
   - LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) with multiple waveforms
   - Frequency modulation depth and rate controls
   - Amplitude modulation with envelope followers
   - Phase modulation for complex timbres

3. MULTI-OSCILLATOR CAPABILITY
   - Up to 8 frequency players simultaneously
   - Detuning controls for chorus/ensemble effects
   - Individual pan positioning for spatial effects
   - Cross-modulation between oscillators

4. REAL-TIME ANALYSIS INTEGRATION
   - Visual feedback showing current frequency output
