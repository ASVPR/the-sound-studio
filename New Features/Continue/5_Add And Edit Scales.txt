Add And Edit Scales - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

OVERVIEW:
Comprehensive scale management system allowing users to create, edit, and manage custom musical scales beyond the current built-in scale collection.

CURRENT STATUS: ⏳ READY FOR ENHANCEMENT
The Sound Studio has built-in scales (Diatonic, Chromatic, Harmonic, etc.) but lacks user scale creation capabilities.

PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS:

1. SCALE EDITOR INTERFACE
   - Interactive scale construction with piano keyboard interface
   - Cent-based precise interval editing
   - Ratio-based just intonation scale creation
   - Visual representation of scale intervals and relationships

2. CUSTOM SCALE TYPES SUPPORT
   - Microtonal scales with arbitrary divisions per octave
   - Non-octave-repeating scales
   - Traditional world music scales (Arabic maqams, Indian ragas, etc.)
   - Experimental and mathematical scales

3. SCALE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   - Save/Load custom scales with descriptive names
   - Scale categorization and tagging system
   - Import scales from Scala format (.scl files)
   - Export scales to various formats
   - Share scales between projects

4. SCALE ANALYSIS TOOLS
   - Interval analysis showing all scale intervals
   - Harmonic relationship visualization
   - Scale comparison tools
   - Consonance/dissonance analysis based on harmonic ratios

5. INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING FEATURES
   - Real-time scale switching in Chord Player
   - Scale-aware chord suggestions and progressions
   - Frequency Player automatic scale quantization option
   - Scale visualization in spectrum analysis

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Scale Data Structure:
```cpp
struct CustomScale {
    String name;
    String description; 
    String category;
    Array<float> intervals; // In cents from root
    float octaveRatio;      // Usually 2.0, but can vary
    bool isRepeating;       // Whether scale repeats at octave
};
```

Key Components:
- ScaleEditor component with interactive interface
- ScaleManager class for scale persistence and organization  
- Enhanced FrequencyManager integration
- Scale file I/O system with multiple format support

MUSICAL BENEFITS:
- Support for world music traditions
- Microtonal composition capabilities  
- Historical temperament recreation
- Experimental music composition tools
- Educational exploration of different tuning systems

FILE FORMATS SUPPORTED:
- Scala format (.scl) - industry standard
- JSON format for complete scale data
- CSV format for simple interval lists
- Native TSS format with full metadata

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- FrequencyManager scale system enhancement
- ChordPlayerProcessor scale-aware chord generation
- Settings management for scale persistence
- UI components for scale selection throughout application

ESTIMATED COMPLEXITY: Medium-Hard
Requires significant UI development, file I/O system, and integration
with existing frequency/chord management systems.

EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
This feature transforms The Sound Studio into a comprehensive tool for
exploring musical tuning systems, making it valuable for:
- Music education and theory demonstration
- Ethnomusicology research  
- Composition in alternative tuning systems
- Historical performance practice
