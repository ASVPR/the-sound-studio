Chord Player Settings - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

OVERVIEW:
Advanced settings UI for the Chord Player module with enhanced parameter control, preset management, and real-time configuration options.

CURRENT STATUS: ⏳ READY FOR ENHANCEMENT
The basic Chord Player functionality exists but lacks advanced settings interface.

PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS:

1. ADVANCED PARAMETER INTERFACE
   - Individual synthesis parameter control per shortcut key (A-R)
   - Real-time ADSR envelope adjustment with visual feedback
   - Synthesis algorithm selection per shortcut (Physical/Karplus-Strong/Wavetable)
   - Advanced tuning controls beyond basic A4 frequency

2. PRESET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
   - Save/Load chord player configurations
   - Named preset slots with descriptions
   - Import/Export settings to file
   - Factory presets for common musical styles

3. VISUAL FEEDBACK ENHANCEMENTS
   - Real-time waveform display for active synthesis
   - Spectral analysis overlay for chord output
   - MIDI note display showing currently playing notes
   - Visual envelope display with attack/decay/sustain/release curves

4. ADVANCED CHORD FEATURES
   - Chord progression sequencing
   - Automatic chord suggestions based on key
   - Chord inversion controls
   - Voice leading optimization

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Enhanced ChordPlayerSettingsComponent class
- Settings persistence system using ValueTree
- Real-time parameter callback system
- Visual feedback components (meters, oscilloscopes, spectrum displays)

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- ChordPlayerProcessor parameter management
- ProjectManager settings storage
- SynthesisEngine parameter control
- UI component layout system

ESTIMATED COMPLEXITY: Medium
This enhancement builds on existing chord player foundation and requires
moderate UI development and settings management implementation.
