Amplitude And Envelope - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

OVERVIEW:
Advanced ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope controls with sophisticated amplitude modulation and envelope shaping capabilities.

CURRENT STATUS: ⏳ READY FOR ENHANCEMENT
Basic amplitude and envelope controls exist but need professional-grade enhancement with visual feedback and advanced shaping options.

PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS:

1. ADVANCED ADSR ENVELOPE SYSTEM
   - Visual envelope editor with drag-and-drop curve editing
   - Multiple envelope stages beyond basic ADSR
   - Curve shaping options (linear, exponential, logarithmic, custom)
   - Envelope time scaling and tempo synchronization

2. MULTI-ENVELOPE ARCHITECTURE  
   - Independent envelopes for amplitude, filter, pitch
   - Envelope routing matrix for flexible modulation
   - Envelope triggering options (key on/off, LFO, external)
   - Polyphonic envelope handling for chord playing

3. AMPLITUDE MODULATION SYSTEM
   - Multiple LFO sources with various waveforms
   - Ring modulation capabilities
   - Amplitude following and ducking effects
   - Dynamic range compression and limiting

4. VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM
   - Real-time envelope visualization during playback  
   - Amplitude meters with peak and RMS display
   - Envelope stage indicators showing current position
   - Historical amplitude plotting over time

5. PRESET AND AUTOMATION
   - Named envelope presets for different instrument types
   - Envelope morphing between presets
   - Parameter automation recording and playback
   - MIDI controller mapping for real-time control

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Enhanced ADSR Class:
```cpp
class AdvancedEnvelope {
    enum Stage { ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, RELEASE, IDLE };
    enum CurveType { LINEAR, EXPONENTIAL, LOGARITHMIC, CUSTOM };
    
    struct EnvelopeStage {
        float duration;     // In seconds or beats
        float targetLevel;  // 0.0 to 1.0
        CurveType curve;    // Curve shape
        Array<Point<float>> customCurve; // For custom curves
    };
    
    Array<EnvelopeStage> stages;
    // ... implementation
};
```

PRESET LIBRARY:
- Piano: Quick attack, moderate decay, high sustain, medium release
- Strings: Slow attack, long decay, high sustain, long release  
- Percussion: Instant attack, fast decay, no sustain, short release
- Brass: Medium attack, short decay, high sustain, medium release
- Pad: Very slow attack, long decay, medium sustain, very long release

ESTIMATED COMPLEXITY: Medium-Hard
Requires significant UI development for visual envelope editing,
advanced mathematical curve calculations, and integration with
existing synthesis architecture.

This enhancement transforms basic amplitude control into a
professional-grade envelope system suitable for serious music
production and sound design applications.
